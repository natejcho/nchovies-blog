I watched a video on youtube on how this guy started an ecommerce site. I thought about how low resource it was. pretty cheap startup costs

In the end my costs included shirt samples. domain name. shopify fee.
then advertisements

he recommended finding a niche and so when i was thinking of a product, i thought about what i cared about right now. what could i make that i could be proud of.
I had been following the hong kong story a lot. maybe because of my taiwanese girlfriend or maybe because i've been aligning more with my asian identity. I figured why don't i make shirts supporting the cause.

what ended up happening was I wanted to do it right. I made the shirt black. My girlfriend asked me if that's the slogan still. I looked that up. i looked up why they dressed in all black. Discovered Black Bloc. I found other resources to point my supposed clientelle to. I found the be water hkg twitter.

it's weird i can have 'wrong' (though i don't think making money is inherently bad) intentions but learn more, become educated. And gained even more sympathy. my discussions are more rich.

i didn't make too much.

i added bitcoin
