I want to be a digital nomad. My desires are ultimately selfish, I am seeking out a lifestyle where I can be a nomad. I would enjoy a side effect that makes positive change in the world. I think the world is better than it's ever been, and I'm a generally pretty happy person. But I believe the world can be so much better, and overall is pretty shit.
I want to inspire peoplpe to live a life similar to my own. and share my journey in doing so.

obviously this is being said from a place of extreme privelege. I am not saying this is the only way to live life. But rather if you have the opportunity to, it would be disrespectful not to at least try. at least for the sake of those who can't

thing's i care about right now:

- hong kong
- democracy
- equal opportunity
- blockchain
- progessivism
-
