Money becomes more divisible and fungible. we went from equal exchange, to equivalent exchange. My cow for you 3 sheep. that took adoption -> shells -> precious metal -> cash -> credit card -> online banking -> i think next is bitcoin

metal was a weird change. things started to centralize
nick szabo made clear

we are looking to decentralize.

my concerns so far is that the currency is intentionally deflationary. which incentivizes people to save. economic slowdown.

i want to build a startup that supports the economy.

i downloaded twitter. started this passion from a talk with a friend and then it intensified DYOR. a blog on hackernoon interviewed influential or significant figures in the bitcoin space.

most are pretty against alt coins and one explicitly advised against building on the ethereum blockchain.
